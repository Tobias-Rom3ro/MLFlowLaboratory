Here are a few options, depending on the nuance you want to convey:

*   **Machine learning has revolutionized the way we process and analyze large volumes of data in real time.** (This is the most direct and common translation.)

*   **Machine learning has transformed how we process and analyze massive datasets in real time.** (This emphasizes the scale of the data.)

*   **Machine learning has brought about a revolution in how we process and analyze large datasets in real time.** (This emphasizes the revolutionary aspect.)

All three are perfectly acceptable and convey the core meaning of the original Spanish sentence.  The first one is probably the most natural and widely understood.
