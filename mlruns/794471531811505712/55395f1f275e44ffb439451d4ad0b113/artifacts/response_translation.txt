Here's a natural English translation of your sentence:  

**"Machine learning has revolutionized the way we process and analyze large volumes of data in real time."**  

### Key Adjustments:  
- **"El machine learning"** → Just "Machine learning" (no article needed in English).  
- **"Grandes volúmenes de datos"** → "Large volumes of data" (a common phrasing in data science contexts).  
- **"En tiempo real"** → "In real time" (hyphenated when used as an adjective before a noun, e.g., "real-time analysis," but not here).  

Let me know if you'd like any refinements for a specific context!
